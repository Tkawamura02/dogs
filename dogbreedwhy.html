        <h2>Why Should I get a Dog?</h2>
        <p>
            As many other websites mention, spending time with canine companions has been researched. And 
            dogs have been proven to make us happier and healthier. Since caring for a dog is hard work 
            make sure to think about this thoroughly since it is a lifetime commitment. Your dog will be 
            relying on you for the majority of their needs but will pay you tenfold by showering you with 
            their happiness and love when you come back home!
        </p>

        <br><br>
        <h4>Exercise</h4>
        <p>
            Something that is very noticeable is the fact that dogs require exercise which usually forces 
            their owners to take them on a walk in the park. They love to chase after balls and play in 
            the grass. Not only this but when you walk them outside, you are bound to meet another dog 
            lover that will trigger a conversation about your cute pooch. This can add to your social life. 
            Simply owning a dog can also lengthen your age and life span. Research and studies between 1950 
            and 2019 found that dog ownders had a lower risk of death and better response to stress.
        </p>
        <h4>Blood Pressure</h4>
        <p>
            This is mentioned a lot but it is a very important fact. Dogs have an amazing ability to make us 
            feel calmer. And this has a brilliant effect on our health because dog owners typically have a 
            lower blood pressure which is both due to the increase in exercise and when you pet your dog this 
            naturally lowers your blood pressure. So when you are feeling stressed and want to relax, petting 
            your pooch not only makes them feel better but yourself as well! 
        </p>
        <h4>Companionship</h4>
        <p>
            This is a popular fact about owning a pet. Owning a dog is a great way to make us feel less alone. 
            Depending on what pets you prefer to own, you can own hamsters, cats, horses, etc. But ownders that 
            own pets are typically less likely to experience loneliness. Dogs are known for offering unconditional 
            love, emotional support and constand cuddles which help make their owners experience little to no 
            social isolation.
        </p>
        <h4>Mood Improvement</h4>
        <p>
            Dogs are known to increase your mood. Not only does petting them help improve or lower your blood 
            pressure, they can also make you happier. Studies done on dog owners prove that dog owners are less 
            likely to be depressed and have higher levels of serotonin and dopamin then a non-dog owner. Therefore, 
            they are natural treatments for depression and anxiety. 
        </p>
        <h4>Responsibility</h4>
        <p>
            Dogs require a lot of care and love because they are rather social animals. This alone makes them the 
            great animal for teaching one responsibility since you are responsible for another being which depends 
            on you and can somewhat communicate with you. To have a general idea of what dogs require, I will list 
            on some things. They need to be fed, healthy, groomed, walked, etc. Similar to owning a baby, your 
            house should be dog-proof to avoid the ingestion of hurtful items. You are responsible for the health 
            and safety of your dog and this is a big responsibility.
